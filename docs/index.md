Over the years I have worked on a few personal projects and documented fully or partially the most interesting ones. Instead of keeping the documentation for myself I have decided to share it in a very lightweight format. To do so I use mkdocs and Material for MkDocs which are very powerful tools and make the writing and sharing of documentation extremely easy.
